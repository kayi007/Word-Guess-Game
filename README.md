# Overview

I choose Game Of Throne as the theme of my game! A GOT theme: GOT questions, GOT sound and GOT aesthetic. 

The game uses key events/keyboard to listen for the letters that players will type.

The following will display on the page:

Press any key to get started!

Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

The words will be displayed like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.

As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: (e.g) s t _  _ k.

Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user) User gets 12 chances to get the correct word.

Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).

After the user wins/loses the game, it will automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

There are pictures on the side as hints to help the players for the game.

GOT theme song will be playing as the players are playing the game.
